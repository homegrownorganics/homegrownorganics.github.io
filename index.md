## üå± Nourishing community, soil, and spirit

**We‚Äôre not a business. We‚Äôre a movement.**

Homegrown is a regenerative, community-powered food initiative based in ≈åtautahi. We rescue high-quality organic produce from local farms and turn it into **nourishing soup**.

## Our Story

Homegrown started from a simple belief: that good food should nourish everyone, and nothing should go to waste. Based in Christchurch, we work directly with local organic farmers to rescue produce that‚Äôs perfectly good but can‚Äôt be sold due to cosmetic standards or overproduction.

Every week, we transform this rescued food into:

- **Hearty soups** made with seasonal vegetables

## Want to Help?

We‚Äôre always looking for passionate people to join our movement:

- **Volunteers** to help with food prep and distribution
- **Partner farms** with surplus organic produce
- **Community supporters** to spread the word
